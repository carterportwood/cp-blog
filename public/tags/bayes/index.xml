      <description>In a prior post, I showed how to compare expected interval lengths and coverages. In this post, I’ll show how you can leverage your prior knowledge to get better binomial confidence intervals.
When constructing a binomial confidence interval, it’s rare that one has no prior information about what the proportion of interest is. For instance, even if I know nothing about the proportion of defects at a factory, for most factories, I can safely assume that it’s more likely to be 10% than it is to be 90%.</description>
