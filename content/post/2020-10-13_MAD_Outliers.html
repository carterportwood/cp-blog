<p>In this post, I show how to set the cutoff for MAD-based outlier detection. This is not meant to be an explainer about MAD outlier detection since there’s already good resources (here)[] and (here)[].</p>
<p>A colleague recent came to me asking for advice about automated univarite outlier detection. I wasn’t all that familiar with outlier detection. After doing some reading, I found a method that suited our purposes well: outlier detection using the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sample = rnorm(20)
sample = c(sample, 20)
hist(sample, breaks=50)
rug(sample)</code></pre>
