I'm currently a Clinical Data Scientist at [Cytovale](https://cytovale.com/). We're working to commercialize a [microfluidic sepsis diagnostic](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29630392/). Here are the things I've been working on lately:
- informing decision-making with rigorous statistical inference
- biostats consulting for clinical research
- providing statistical guidance for verification study design
- building predictive models
- designing analytical validation studies for FDA submission
